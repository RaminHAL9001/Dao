-- | When you begin a GHCI interactive REPL session, it is a good idea to import this module first.
-- This module provides functions defined to be easy-to-type into the GHCI Read-Eval-Print Loop so
-- that you can begin constructing Dao production rule databases, and testing your database with
-- simple queries to see if it works.
--
-- There are also features for doing simple debugging of query execution, so you can see what
-- production rules are reacting to which queries, and trace program execution so as to see what
-- data is being constructed and returned (or what errors are thrown) in reaction to the query.
--
-- TODO: write all of the code for this module.
