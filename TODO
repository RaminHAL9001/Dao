TODO:
*	The "Dao.Object.Show" module is dreadfully out of data, it needs to be cleaned up for all the
changes made to the abstract syntax tree.

*	There seems to be a bug with the 'Dao.Objcet.IfThenElse' branch of the abstract syntax tree. I
am having difficulty getting if expressions to evaluate correctly.

*	'Dao.Object.Subroutine' is a data structure representing a function that takes a list of
'Dao.Object.ObjPat's, and when it is executed, it will resolve all Reference parameters passed to
them to create a list of parameters, match this list of parameter arguments to this list of
'Dao.Object.ObjPat's, then run the associated 'Dao.Object.Executable'.
	It might be a good idea to allow other kinds of 'Subroutine's, including "pure" subroutines that
simply evaluate to (CEError Object), functions take a list of Objects that are not automatically
resolve references passed to them. Since built-in operators are pure subroutines, an API for
evaluating these operator functions could be constructed to evaluate both built-in operators and
custom native functions. Also, right now the evaluator checks if an operator is an assignment or
update operator, and treats these as special cases. However, if there is a "pure" subroutine that
takes parameters that are not resolved automatically, the update operators can be defined as
object instances of this type of "pure" subroutine.
