TODO:

* Improve the testing suite.

* Find and correct as many bugs as possible.

* Create a nice library of example code which can also serve as testing
	code.

* Document all public APIs. Try to re-arrange the code to make it more
	literate, make sure Haddock produces very nice, easy-to-read
	documentation for everything.

* Clean-up exception objects and the error reporting mechanism. The
	various exception objects that can be thrown by the interpreter
	need to be much better organized than they are now.

* Implement the type checking system.

* Once the type checking system is working, allow Dao programs to be
	type-checked, optimized, converted to the built-in binary format,
	and stored in an object file which can be loaded more efficiently
	than interpreted code.

* Add more Dao language bindings to useful Haskell data types.

* Provide a larger variety of useful built-in functions.

* Make the interpreter smaller and more efficient.
