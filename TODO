Since I have completely gutted the Dao interpreter, implementing an entirely new scheme for
referencing objects by making references first-class values, and also eliminated the PredicateIO
scheme of checking function parameters to foreign functions, the old TODO file has had no relevance
to the development currently underway, so I deleted it and I am starting anew.

TODO:
*	There is a bug in the indexing operator, and also possibly the dereferencing operator.
Indexing an item in a list or array (for example: a[0]) throws an exception, indexing an item
in a list that has first been dereferenced (for example: @a[0]) seems to return nothing.

*	'Dao.Object.Subroutine' is a data structure representing a function that takes a list of
'Dao.Object.ObjPat's, and when it is executed, it will resolve all Reference parameters passed to
them to create a list of parameters, match this list of parameter arguments to this list of
'Dao.Object.ObjPat's, then run the associated 'Dao.Object.Executable'.
	It might be a good idea to allow other kinds of 'Subroutine's, including "pure" subroutines that
simply evaluate to (CEError Object), functions take a list of Objects that are not automatically
resolve references passed to them. Since built-in operators are pure subroutines, an API for
evaluating these operator functions could be constructed to evaluate both built-in operators and
custom native functions. Also, right now the evaluator checks if an operator is an assignment or
update operator, and treats these as special cases. However, if there is a "pure" subroutine that
takes parameters that are not resolved automatically, the update operators can be defined as
object instances of this type of "pure" subroutine.
