Since I have completely gutted the Dao interpreter, implementing an entirely new scheme for
referencing objects by making references first-class values, and also eliminated the PredicateIO
scheme of checking function parameters to foreign functions, the old TODO file has had no relevance
to the development currently underway, so I deleted it and I am starting anew.

TODO:
*	Recursive input is placed into the "recursiveInput" MVar of the ExecUnit data type, however the
runtime does not seem to do anything with these input strings. I probably took out that feature
because it relied too heavily on PredicateIO or something I deleted, and I need to completely
rewrite it. This needs to be investigated, and finally implemented.
