dao-0.1.0.0

This is a pre-release of Dao. Some major changes are in the works and
I would like to begin committing these changes to the master
repository.

The full release of Dao will be pretty unrecognizable from the state
it is in now. The most important algorithms, namely "Dao.Interval"
(previously "Dao.EnumSet"), "Dao.Tree", and "Dao.Predicate" are all
mostly the same as before. However "Dao.Parser" is going to be
completely revamped. And the entire language specification will
probably change. I will make the current JavaScript-like language an
optional module, and remove it from the main Dao library. The new Dao
programming language will be more like typed Bash (Bourne Shell,
similar to Lisp or Scheme). None of these changes are in this release.
