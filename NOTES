Dao-1.0.0.0

A pure Haskell dynamically typed DSL for production rule-based-logic programming and AI.

Dao is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) intended providing tools
for logic programming and constructing knowledge bases, with a
focus on artificial intelligence. Reminiscient of the PROLOG
programming language, but made better with Haskell's static
type checking and clean semantics, Dao is well suited for
things like type checking, computing build dependencies,
whole-program analysis, rapid prototyping of parsers, and
Read-Eval-Print Loop-based (REPL-based) source code
development, as well as natural language comprehension.

Dao originally defined a JavaScript-like programming
language for defining production rule databases suited to
natural language understanding, but now it is just a DSL with
tools for defining grammars and parsers, where all production
rules are defined in a Haskell program using the Dao APIs.
